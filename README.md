#TIY - Homework 11
##Etsy Listings Page

This is a challenge to use data directly from [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com)'s API to construct a look-alike search results page. 

I'm following "hard mode" rules for my project, which means the finished page should have proper listings, sorting & categorizing functionality, and hover effects on the listings themselves. Links should presumably be live as well. I've extended these specs just a bit by making a live AJAX query against the API versus using `curl` or `wget` to get a static snapshot of data.

Project started on Jan 22nd @ ~3 PM.
