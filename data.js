It has never been used and is very good condition. It has 6 big size coloured photos of birds. They are Purple Finch, White-Throated Sparrow, Pintail Duck, Slate--Coloured Junco, Flicker and the Golden- Crowned Kinglet, Ruby- Crowned Kinglet. The calendar measures approx.: 25&quot; x 13 1\/2&quot;. Each bird photo on the calendar measures approx.: 14&quot; x 10&quot;. They would be great framed. On the back of each sheet is a full description of the birds.  Lots of detail to each photo and the highest quality paper they used to make this calendar. The month actually begins May 1957 and end April 1958. That&#39;s the way it was made. It was produced by courtesy of the National Audubon Society, New York. The artist is Allen Brooks and he is well known for his birds.\r\n\r\nAny questions just e mail me.

The  top portion  is so dramatic against the deep plum colored background.  Giving energy to the flowers that float on the plum surface.  The green is a great base for this dress, as if they were the vines and stems attached to the flowers up top.  And the lavender trim in the middle is so beautiful with its 3 dimensional buds gracing the dress.
